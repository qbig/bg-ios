#UI Considerations


##Staff/Main
(Discussion on same sized cards for viewing)

####Mode1: Regular Standby

####Mode2: Entering Orders into POS
Toggles from "Equal Overview" to "First Order as Focus"

Can be triggered in any of the following ways:

* user clicks "Start Entering Orders into POS" button on the top right hand corner of the page.
* user clicks "Acknowledge" on any order card.
* user clicks "Expand" on any order card.
(because all these actions indicate that the user is starting to look at the order cards to enter them into the restaurant's POS system.)

####View1: Equal Overview (The Usual Mode)
See all order cards. All cards are of the same size. Cards with long orders are truncated. Has an "Expand" button.

####View2: First Order as Focus (When the person wants to enter into the POS)
The first (most urgent) order card takes center stage.

Since the user can only key in one order card into the POS at one time, the order card that he is keying in, should take the center stage.

The details in the rest of the cards don't really matter during this time. Perhaps only the green/red urgency threshold of the other cards should be shown.

It should automatically expand itself.

Once the user clicks Acknowledge, the current card should be hidden and the next card should move in as the First Order Card.
