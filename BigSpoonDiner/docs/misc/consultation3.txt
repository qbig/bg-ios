Feedback for RESTAURANT STAFF PORTAL
=========================

---------------
(#) Notification whenever a new order/request is created
Notifications should be repeated until it is acknowledged.
Case Scenario: Someone left it in the wrong tab.

Socketio needs to refresh at table view.


---------------
** I think we need to show the workflow, to indicate what the Restaurant Staff intends to do.
Coz a layman (the kind of people that we'll be demo-ing to) will not know why there's acknowledge. **
Things that the layman will not know:
- Why is there a field for POS



---------------

How is the restaurant supposed to know that 

It doesn't prompt the user if an order is made and the the user is not in the Home View.


---------------
HISTORY VIEW

How do I get rid of all the tables?
How do I know if the table is occupied or empty? If there's someone here?
- We do not show because it would not be accurate. Not everyone will be using the app.
So it will not be accurate information.

Table - History
Want to show history -> Difficult to tell what's present and what's past.
What happens when every table has 30-40 people sitting there every day.

---------------

1. What's the difference between Acknowledge and Respond?





Adding padding-bottom: 20px to card
Change "Home" to "Right Now"
Table view is confusing and needs to be more navigable

Allergies appear as fgg - may confuse people if 


Table = bad
History vs present not clear

How to check yesterday's history?
To filter the date.
History is not very useful, it doesn't give me a total -> the total amount made today.

What's the point of the history view. The past order that has already been processed.

Repeats - trigger notification every minute.
snooze?



==================================================
Feedback for USER APP
=========================

(#1) Button position
Breakfast button is too close to the back button.
Suyuen tried to click on the Image, instead of the plus.
Make the whole thing clickable.

(#2) Should tell the customer that the Staff has acknowledged.
A notification.
*** Feedback loop ***
The order is "PENDING".
The staff has acknowledged your order. - ACKNOWLEDGED
The waiter is coming.
Show more information.
When you do credit card processing, it tells you not to refresh.

(#3) Perserve the notes even if the cancel button is pressed.

(#4) Order history of the current meal -> confuses the user.
Should show user that the current meal
