# #1 Preparation

###Step1: Big Idea/Concept

￼￼Unique Name: BigSpoon

Idea: Personal Waiter on the Mobile Phone.

Allow customers to get their orders to the restaurant immediately without the frustration of trying to grab the attention of the waiter and waiting for a waiter to take their orders. It is to allow instant gratification.

Allow restaurants to receive orders seamlessly and reduce the number of waiters they need to hire for taking orders.

The goal is to:

* Reduce manpower costs.
* Increase productivity.
* Increase satisfaction of the customers.


###Step 2: Target User/User Persona

There are 2 target users. The restaurant manager and the customer. There is also a target beneficary, the restaurant owner.

The restaurant owner has received complaints from customers about the waiting time, especially during peak hours. He wants to reduce the waiting time and it will require the hiring of more waiters, but he does not have the money to do so. It is also difficult for him to hire extra waiters for only the few hours during the peak hours.

The restaurant manager is a 38 year old employee of a restaurant who is used to taking orders from pieces of paper that waiters pass to him.

The customer is a 27 year old white collar worker who visits restaurants during the peak hours.
He faces long waiting times between sitting down at a table in the restaurant to having a waiter take the order from him. He often has to try and get the waiter's attention for the waiter to take his orders.
He also faces long waiting times between having his order taken and receiving the food.

He also notices that the waiter walks around to a few other tables before passing all the orders to the kitchen, because other customers also called for the waiter to make requests for things like water, napkins.


###Step 3: Collecting Feedback
These are the findings after 12 restaurants were contacted and pitched the idea.

The restaurant owners liked the fact that people can order on their own, which can help them save manpower costs and also avoid frustrations that the waiters currently face.

Very often, the waiters are busy and have a lot of things to do. At the same time, they often have many people raising their hands. Frustration of the waiter. A lot of things to do, so many people raising hands. Get flustered.

They would also love to have information on the diners. A CRM of the diners.

However, they are not sure that the app can be incorporated into their operations, because it involves changing their processes. It will be unfamiliar territory.

There are also some restaurants that want the waiters to take the order. Hence, they are hesistant to use the app in their operations.


###Step 4: Content/Requirements

Many of the restaurants have an existing process of taking orders: (1) customers try to get the attention of the waiters, (2) the waiters take orders on paper and (3) the paper order is then keyed into to their existing POS system.

Their existing POS systems often cost a considerable amount of money and they are unwilling to change them.

Given the circumstances of the restaurants as well as the duration of this project, our aim is to replace the first 2 parts of the process, where customers flag waiters and waiters take the orders.

This is to enable us to focus on refining the apps serving those processes, to allow BigSpoon to scale to the maximum possible number of restaurants in the given timeframe available for the project, because there will not be sufficient time to integrate with the individual POS systems of each and every restaurant.

As such, we have decided to offer a web app made for the tablet fo the restuarant owner, and a mobile app for smartphones for the customers.

The mobile app will allow customers to send orders to the restaurant if they are within the vicinity of the restaurant.

The tablet app will allow the restaurant manager to do 4 things. (1) He can view the list of new orders that he has yet to key into the POS system, which replaces the pieces of paper that the waiters give him.

#####Refining of Persona
We are adding one more Person. The waiter. He is a 25 year old employee of the restaurant who struggles to handle the overwhelming number of customer requests, and gets frustrated as a result of that.
